This year is the eighth time the activity is being hold. The main purpose of MIC is to provide the students with the opportunity to bring the skills they've learned during the class into practice. Therefore, the abilities that the students have, such as making CV and giving speech, get improved then.
Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications is an engineering majored university with excellent reputation in telecommunication and information area. The students of BUPT are of no doubts to be good at science courses. However, since we started all science education early, the time and energy we spent on the humanity courses are too short to be mentioned. Even with the well effect of the "general education" from the university, the attention students have paid is far less than the expectation of the country and the teachers. 
In this case, International School carries out this International Model Conference and sets the main topic as "Technology and Humanity", so that students can get a better understanding on the techniques and the applications in their own major area, and at the same time their personal quality get promoted. In other words, the 8th MIC is hoping to help students to be "complete".
On top of that, the conference is expected to provide a chance for students to experience the whole process of an international conference. While improving the skills in English and communication, the students' life in campus is colored.</br></br></br></span>
