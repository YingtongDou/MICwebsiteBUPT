After the initial interviews which are based on the cover letters and resumes sent via e-mails from the applicants, hundreds of students come together to compete for the attracting positions of Human Resources Department, Academic Department, Secretary Department, Concierge Department, IT Department, Field Department, Financial Department and Market and Promotion Department.</span></td>
      </tr></table>
<span class="details">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, the thesis of MIC is "Technology and Humanity". Different departments hold the interviews in different classrooms and the applicants have to take the interview one by one. In the process of interviews, many applicants shown their most competent specialty over others and tactfully gave answers to the questions put forward by the interviewers from corresponding departments. Besides, there are four or five interviewers for each department and each interview may last ten minutes or so. To have a good understanding whether the applicants are truly adequate and suitable for the jobs, interviewers came along with many questions concerning the potential dilemmas or the conceivable knotty problems that the applicants may be confronted with if they were employed in the future.
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final result of the interviews will take account of both the applicants' performances in the interview and the suggestions and considerations from the teachers of communication skills class. In addition, the results will be released in few days this week and students who pass this round of interviews will have a special train before they officially embark on the related work.
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of the interviews is expected to bring a large number of excellent staffs for the 9th MIC of international school, BUPT. And these outstanding students will surely contribute to the final success of the conference through their painstaking and wholehearted work. Also, students involved in the conference will improve their abilities to a large extent and enlarge their friend circle greatly.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="News.html"><< back</a></br></br></br></span>
