    			<p>The procedure of organizing and participating in the <strong>Model International Conference</strong> is one of the most significant modules in the communication skills class that International School set. This year is the eighth time the activity is being hold. The main purpose of MIC is to provide the students with the opportunity to bring the skills they’ve learned during the class into practice. Therefore, the abilities that the students have, such as making CV and giving speechs, get improved then.
</p> 
				<p>The students of BUPT are of no doubts to be good at science courses. However, since we started all science education early, the time and energy we spent on the humanity courses are too short to be mentioned. Even with the well effect of the <em>“general education”</em> from the university, the attention students have paid is far less than the expectation of the country and the teachers. </p>
				<p>In this case, International School carries out this International Model Conference and sets the main topic as “Technology and Humanity”, so that students can get a better understanding on the techniques and the applications in their own major area, and at the same time their personal quality get promoted. In other words, the 8th MIC is hoping to help students to be “complete”.
On top of that, the conference is expected to provide a chance for students to experience the whole process of an international conference. While improving the skills in English and communication, the students’ life in campus is colored.

<p>Technology and humanity are precious treasure which human created in the evolution of human society. People develop technology and humanity and also benefit from the development of technology and humanity. Although they have different meaning and maybe have some contraction, neither of them can be ignored. Attaching the same importance to technology and humanity, people can not only explore the secret of truth, but also reflect on the destiny and value of individuals. They are just like two wings of the society, taking human to a higher level of civilization. Based on the theme importance to technology and humanity, people can not only explore the secretPosts and Telecommunications will hold a model international conference in May 10th, 2014. Related fields of the conference are telecommunication, computer science, E-commerce and internet of things.</p>
